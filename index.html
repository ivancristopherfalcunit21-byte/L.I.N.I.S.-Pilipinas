  <h2>What is Corruption?</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>
      Corruption happens when someone uses their power for personal gain instead of serving others. It includes:
      <br><br>
      • Misusing authority<br>
      • Using a position or influence for selfish reasons<br>
      • Gaining benefits that are not fair or legal
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>
      Corruption creates many problems such as:
      <br><br>
      • People losing trust in leaders<br>
      • Poor or slow public services<br>
      • Unfair treatment and more inequality<br>
      • Damage to the environment<br>
      • More crime and unsafe communities
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>
